                         Find Doctor Appointment Management Syatem
Using HTML, CSS, BOOTSTRAP, PHP, JavaScript, and MYSQL SERVER, a simple project titled "The Find Doctor " was produced. There are admin and user sides of the project. The admin side handles all management tasks, such as adding and removing doctor records, verifying patient data, and setting up appointments.

Users for the user section might either be patients or medical professionals. As a doctor, the user can log in and view their schedule, patients, timings, and other information. The user must have their login ID and password for this hospital in order to log in as a patient. The patient must first register as a new patient if they do not already have them. The patient can schedule visits and keep track of their prescriptions, treatments, and other information.

                          About Project
PHP, JavaScript, and CSS are used in this Find doctor appointment page. The admin part and the user section are included in the system's features. The admin component handles all editing, managing doctors, patients, and appointments. The key benefit of this approach is that users may schedule appointments with doctors online rather than physically going to the office. This system's layout is rather straightforward to prevent user troubles when using it.

I hope it will assist folks in obtaining vital health care needed.
